*"I want you to act as a career branding expert specializing in cybersecurity. Help me create a professional cybersecurity engineer portfolio that highlights my technical skills, projects, certifications, and experience in a clean, modern, and recruiter-friendly format. The portfolio should include the following sections:

Introduction / About Me – A concise professional summary that communicates my role as a cybersecurity engineer, my career goals, and what makes me unique.

Skills – A categorized list of my technical skills (e.g., Network Security, Cloud Security, Penetration Testing, Incident Response, SIEM, Firewalls, Threat Intelligence, Python, Bash, etc.).

Certifications – A showcase of my cybersecurity certifications (e.g., CompTIA Security+, CEH, CISSP, OSCP, CCSP, etc.).

Projects / Case Studies – Detailed writeups of at least 3–5 cybersecurity-related projects. For each project, provide:

Problem statement / scenario

Tools & technologies used

Steps taken (methodology)

Outcome / impact

Visuals (network diagrams, screenshots, GitHub links, etc., if possible)

Experience – If available, a structured overview of my professional work (company, role, achievements, and measurable impact).

Education – Relevant academic background.

Contact & Links – Professional email, LinkedIn, GitHub, personal blog, or CTF profiles (like HackTheBox, TryHackMe, etc.).

The portfolio should be written in clear, confident, and professional language that appeals to hiring managers and recruiters in cybersecurity. It should demonstrate both technical expertise and problem-solving ability.
